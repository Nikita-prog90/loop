Java switch Statement
In this tutorial, you will learn to use the switch statement in Java to control the flow of your programâ€™s execution with the help of examples.


The switch statement allows us to execute a block of code among many alternatives.

The syntax of the switch statement in Java is:

switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if
    // expression is equal to value1
    break;
  
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if
    // expression is equal to value2
    break;
  
  ...
  ...
  
  default:
    // default statements
  }
How does the switch statement work?

The expression is evaluated once and compared with the values of each case label.

If there is a match, the corresponding code after the matching case label is executed.

For example, if the value of the expression is equal to value2, the code after case value2: is executed.
If there is no match, the code after default: is executed.
Note: We can do the same functionality using the Java if...else...if ladder. However, the syntax of the switch statement is cleaner and much easier to read and write.

Example 1: Java switch statement
// Java Program to check the size
// using the switch...case statement

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int number = 44;
    String size;

    // switch statement to check size
    switch (number) {

      case 29:
        size = "Small";
        break;

      case 42:
        size = "Medium";
        break;

      // match the value of week
      case 44:
        size = "Large";
        break;

      case 48:
        size = "Extra Large";
        break;
      
      default:
        size = "Unknown";
        break;

    }
    System.out.println("Size: " + size);
  }
}
Output:

Size: Large
