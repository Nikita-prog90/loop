Java switch Statement
In this tutorial, you will learn to use the switch statement in Java to control the flow of your program’s execution with the help of examples.


The switch statement allows us to execute a block of code among many alternatives.

The syntax of the switch statement in Java is:

switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if
    // expression is equal to value1
    break;
  
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if
    // expression is equal to value2
    break;
  
  ...
  ...
  
  default:
    // default statements
  }
How does the switch statement work?

The expression is evaluated once and compared with the values of each case label.

If there is a match, the corresponding code after the matching case label is executed.

For example, if the value of the expression is equal to value2, the code after case value2: is executed.
If there is no match, the code after default: is executed.
Note: We can do the same functionality using the Java if...else...if ladder. However, the syntax of the switch statement is cleaner and much easier to read and write.

Example 1: Java switch statement
// Java Program to check the size
// using the switch...case statement

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int number = 44;
    String size;

    // switch statement to check size
    switch (number) {

      case 29:
        size = "Small";
        break;

      case 42:
        size = "Medium";
        break;

      // match the value of week
      case 44:
        size = "Large";
        break;

      case 48:
        size = "Extra Large";
        break;
      
      default:
        size = "Unknown";
        break;

    }
    System.out.println("Size: " + size);
  }
}
Output:

Size: Large
